Spring playground
=================
This project is a project template, HTML5-ready, that use the latest Spring 3 features and some other stuff, like Mustache templating.
Its goal is to provide me a working configuration, where I can refer to when starting new Spring project.

If other people find it useful, great, feel free to do whatever you want with it.
